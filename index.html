        A deep question with many answers. In a previous life, I was a pogo-dancing punk rocker with a penchant for poetry. All alliteration aside, I have traveled far, read wide, and lived broad. These days, my attention is focused on coding. Though new to Ruby, I love its versatility and the combination of technicality and creativity necessary to wield it. Rails is useful, but I believe that Ruby itself is an art form–an exercise in deceptive simplicity.

      Aside from the standard HTML/CSS combo, which I've been using since 2000, I taught myself PHP in 2015, and in 2017 I attended the <a href="https://bottega.tech/">Bottega Tech</a> bootcamp for their <em>Full Stack Web Developer</em> certification, and received a full scholarship from <a href="https://www.learnenough.com/">The Learn Enough Society</a>. Between the two, I have created websites in Ruby on Rails, Jekyll, Sinatra, Angular, Coffescript, Typescript, jQuery, Bootstrap,  and Sass.
