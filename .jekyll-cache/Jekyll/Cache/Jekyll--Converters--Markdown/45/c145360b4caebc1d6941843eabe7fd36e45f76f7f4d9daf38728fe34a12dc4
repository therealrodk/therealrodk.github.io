I"¹<p>I first started learning HTML some time around the year 2000. I was working for SBC Services, Inc, which has since become AT&amp;T, and we built a site for their intranet, a place for their Human Resources departments to find guidance and documentation. It was a lot of fun, and HTML took hold of me. Of course, we mostly just  had inline styles then, so it was ugly as sin, but <em>boy</em> was I excited when CSS became mainstream!</p>
